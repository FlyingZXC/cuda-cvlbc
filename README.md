Completed Volume Local Binary Count Pattern (cuda version)
=================================

Viewing a gray-scale video as a 3D volume, its VLBC and CVLBC features are extracted for dynamic texture recognition or 2D face spoofing detection. For more information, please refer to the paper http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8030131/.

Complilation
============

This project is compiled with g++ and cuda-toolbox-8.0.


Usage
=====

In the file cvlbc.cu, an example of extracting features from the videos in the Print-Attack is presented. Firstly, the frames of a given gray-scale video are converted to gray-scale pgm files and are named consecutively, e.g., 1.pgm, 2.pgm.... Then, these pgm images are loaded one-by-one, resulting in a 2D array. Finally, features are extracted from the array.
